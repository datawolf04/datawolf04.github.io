# The end:

I can make this pretty video using Manim!

{{< video collisionViz/media/videos/puckStickCollision/1080p60/puckStickCollision.mp4 >}}


# The beginning:

I've been making some visualizations for my physics classes. I've used VPython/Glowscript in the past however, that wasn't working for me, and I couldn't track the bugs. I've been meaning to play with [Manim](https://www.manim.community/). So, I've done that!

# The physics:
## First, set up the problem
For this calculation, I'll be working in the LAB frame (with the initial velocity, and initial angular velocity of the stick equal to zero).

![](puckStickDemo.png)

After the collision is complete, I will define:

- $\vec{v}_1 = (v_1, 0)$ is the velocity of the puck.  During the collision, we'll assume that the force that the stick exerts on the puck is purely horizontal. Therefore, the final velocity of the puck will be also in the $x-$direction.
- $\vec{v}_2 = (v_2, 0)$ is the velocity of the stick's *center of mass*.  During the collision, the puck's force on the stick is purely horizontal. Therefore, the final velocity of the stick's center of mass will be also in the $x-$direction.
- $\omega_2$ is the z-component of the angular velocity of the stick about it's center of mass.


## Now, do the collision physics

Conservation of momentum in the $x-$direction:

$$
m_1 u_1 = m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2
$$

Conservation of angular momentum in the $z-$direction:
$$
m_1 u_1 b = m_1 v_1 b + I\omega_2
$$
where $I$ is the moment of inertia of a stick with length $L$ about it's center of mass: $I = \frac{1}{12}m_2 L^2$.

### Coefficient of restitution
The coefficient of restitution is generally defined as the "bounciness" of a collision. The coefficient of restitution has the following properties

- $\varepsilon = 1$ for *Elastic collisions*
- $\varepsilon < 1$ for *Inelastic collisions*
- $\varepsilon = 0$ for *Totally inelastic collisions* (This is when the objects stick together)

The coefficient of restitution is defined as:
$$
\varepsilon = \frac{\left|\text{final relative velocity}\right|}{\left|\text{initial relative velocity}\right|} 
$$
For collisions between point particles, we define:
$$
\varepsilon = \frac{\left|\vec{v}_2-\vec{v}_1\right|}{\left|\vec{u}_2-\vec{u}_1\right|} 
$$
where $\vec{u}_1, \vec{u}_2$ are the initial velocities, and $\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2$ are the final velocities of the two objects.

For extended systems, we need to calculate this using the relative velocities of the impact points. For this system, we can define:
$$
\varepsilon = \frac{\left|v_2^* - v_1\right|}{\left|u_1\right|}
$$

where, $v_2^* = v_2 + \omega_2 b$ is the velocity of the impact point on the stick.  This is a common technique used in subsequent mechanics courses.  For this calculation, I will force $\varepsilon \neq 0$ because if the puck "sticks" to the stick like a totally inelastic collision, the motion after will be of a composite object, rather than a separate puck and stick.

## Solve this system of equations
The above 3 conditions provide us with 3 equations relating 3 unknowns $(v_1, v_2, \omega_2)$ in terms of known quantities. I could try to solve these symbolically, but I really don't feel the need to do so. Rather I'll use a numerical technique using the python function `fsolve` in the `scipy` library. To accomplish this, I need to rearrange these equations so that they all equal zero:

$$
\begin{align*}
    0 &= m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 - m_1 u_1\\
    0 &= m_1 v_1 b + I \omega_2 - m_1 u_1 b\\
    0 &= \left|v_2 + b \omega_2 - v_1\right| - \varepsilon\left|u_1\right|
\end{align*}
$$

# The code
I put all of this together in the code [linked here](collisionViz/puckStickCollision.py) and reproduced below. In order for it to work, you'll need to have manim installed on your computer.

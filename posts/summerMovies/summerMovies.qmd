This week we're exploring "summer" movies: movies with *summer* in their title!

The data this week comes from the [Internet Movie Database](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/).


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-07-30')

summer_movie_genres <- tuesdata$summer_movie_genres
summer_movies <- tuesdata$summer_movies

source('cleanSummerMovies.R')
```

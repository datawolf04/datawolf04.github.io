I'm a physicist by training, but a Data Scientist by practice. I've been coding things in R and Python for about 15 years, and I finally decided that I wanted a place to put my fun projects. I also wanted to figure out how [Quarto](https://quarto.org) works. So this is a place for me to do that. Plus, I thought it would be fun to just play with some data. And I just learned about [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md) and the [Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io/).

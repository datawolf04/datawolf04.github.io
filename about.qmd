![](swolfHeadVert.jpg){width=20% style="float:left; padding:10px"} I'm a physicist by training, but a Data Scientist by practice. I've been coding things in R and Python for several years, and I created this website as a place to put my fun projects, organize my thoughts, and do other data science related things. You can find me on LinkedIn, Github, and Google Scholar (links below). You can find me active within different Data Science spheres including [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md) and the [Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io/). When I'm not at work, or playing with data, you can find me outside, I love to go hiking and kayaking.

I'm a physicist by training, but a Data Scientist by practice. I've been coding things in R and Python for several years, and I finally decided that I wanted a place to put my fun projects, organize my thoughts, and do other data science related things. In addition to the places you will find me linked to the bottom, you can find me active with [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md) and the [Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io/).

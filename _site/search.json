I’ve been coding things in R and Python for about 15 years, and I finally decided that I wanted a place to put my fun projects. I also wanted to figure out how Quarto works. So this is a place for me to do that. Plus, I thought it would be fun to just play with some data. And I just learned about #TidyTuesday and the Data Science Learning Community."

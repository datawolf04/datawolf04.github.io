    "text": "Popularity of movie by year\nIn some sense how well-known or popular a movie is should depend on the year. I‚Äôm guessing that very old movies may not have as many votes in the IMDB system. This could also bias the ratings\n\nggplot(summer_movies, aes(x=year,y=num_votes)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Year movie released\",\n    y = \"Number of ratings\",\n    caption = caption_text\n  ) + themeSimple()\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can definitely see that there is a volume bias towards newer movies. Let‚Äôs explore if this shows up in the ratings.\n\nggplot(summer_movies, aes(x=num_votes, y=average_rating, color=year)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  scale_x_log10(breaks = trans_breaks(\"log10\", function(x) 10^x),\n                labels = trans_format(\"log10\", math_format(10^.x))) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,10)) + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Number of ratings\",\n    y = \"Average rating\",\n    colour = \"Year\",\n    caption = caption_text\n  ) + themeSimple()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI‚Äôd say that there are no truly universally bad summer movies (for example with everyone scoring it a 0 or 1 out of 10). It also seems like there is a ‚Äúreversion to the mean‚Äù effect for movies that have more votes, although this could simply be the result of sparse data. By ‚Äúreversion to the mean‚Äù I am referring to the vaguely triangular shape of the blob of points, suggesting that as a movie is rated more and more, the diversity of opinion forces the mean rating to tend away from extreme values."

Despite the recency bias in the rating volume, it would seem that movies can be rated poorly or highly regardless of the year the movie was released. It also seems like there is a “reversion to the mean” effect for movies that have more votes, although this could simply be the result of sparse data. By “reversion to the mean” I am referring to the vaguely triangular shape of the blob of points, suggesting that as a movie is rated more and more, the diversity of opinion forces the mean rating to tend away from extreme values."

    "text": "Data in this dataset:\nFirst, I am planning on analyzing the summer and winter olympics separately. Furthermore, it occurs to me that the year in this dataset should be treated as a factor variable, rather than a numeric variable. This will help if (for example) the olympics were skipped or postponed, and it will definitely help when the winter games were shifted by 2 years so that the intervals between games are uniform.\n\ncountryParticipation &lt;- olympics |&gt; count(noc) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(n)) \n\nMy plan is to plot out participation, medal count, and gold medal count by country NOC region. The reason for this due to the fact that there are an obnoxious number of “teams” (1184) already in this dataset. Also, I don’t think that we want to track the results of “Osborne Swimming Club, Manchester” or “Phalainis ton Thorichtou ‘Psara’-3” on the same level as Spain, China, Brazil, USA, etc. As it stands, there are plenty of countries to keep track of! As it is, there are 230 national olympic committeees.

So the Canadians don’t want to accept this guy? Was Newfoundland it’s own country back then?\n(Feverish googling occurs)\nWell, I’ll be darned, it was! According to Wikipedia:\n\nUntil 1949, the Dominion of Newfoundland was a separate dominion in the British Empire. In 1933, the House of Assembly of the self-governing dominion voted to dissolve itself and to hand over administration of Newfoundland and Labrador to the British-appointed Commission of Government. This followed the suffering caused by the Great Depression and Newfoundland’s participation in the First World War. On March 31, 1949, it became the 10th and most recent province to join the Canadian Confederation as “Newfoundland”. On December 6, 2001, the Constitution of Canada was amended to change the province’s name from “Newfoundland” to “Newfoundland and Labrador”.\n\nHuh…I learn something new every day! And here I thought it was because most Canadians think (insert Newfie joke here)."
